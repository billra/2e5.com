<p>
Volkite is a kite with two skin foil construction on the leading edge and single
skin for the rest of the canopy. It is lighter and uses less material than a standard
parafoil.
<p>
<ul><li> Flat aspect ratio: 3
</li><li> Area: 1.5 m<sup>2</sup>
</li><li> Tip to Tip: 212 cm
</li><li> Chord: 70.5 cm
</li></ul>

The LE has 14 cells comprised of 7 mini-ribs and 6 full ribs.
The mini-ribs stop short of the point where the lower and upper skin
meet, allowing for air passage between adjoining cells. This also helps
to avoid the pucker distortion which can occur when a rib narrows to join
two skins.
<p>
Working with a (partially) single skinned kite is illuminating because it clearly shows
when a section of canopy is not not contributing to lift.

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

NASA-CR-108990, the last article cited in the <a href="../barish/">Barish Sailwing article</a>, contains
a survey of current (as of the late 60's) parachute systems and their performance.
The parachute with the best L/D, 4.3, was the Volplane, ranking above even the parafoils
of the time.
<p>
The Volplane is described in
<a href="http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=w3J1AAAAEBAJ">patent 3524613</a>,
filed April 8, 1968 and titled "Flexible Gliding Wing". William J. Everett, Jr. and the Pioneer Parachute
Company are listed in this patent as well as the
"<a href="../../patent/3428277/">Everett Parawing</a>" patent 3428277.
The Volplane patent is a "continuation in part of" the Everett Parawing
patent, so it can be seen as an amplification and refinement of the ideas introduced
in the patent describing performance improvements of NASA parawings.
<p>
The Volplane can also be seen on page 224 of The Parachute Manual
by Dad Poynter, second edition, ISBN 0-915516-06-3. The Hornet, a similar partially single skinned
parachute is also mentioned in this book.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.parawing-beringer.de/">Beringer</a> Parawing UL is another
kite of the same genre.
<a href="http://users.telenet.be/claeskites/">Jan Claes</a> posted the
Beringer article "Der neue Parawing UL" to the npw9b mailing list showing a foil-like
kite where only the leading edge had two skins. Kai was kind enough to translate
so us non German speaking members could read it.
<p>
Beringer holds German patent number DE9306467U on his creation, titled
"Aerodynamisch geformtes Fluggebilde aus Tuch, Folie o.ä.". This patent can be
found online at the <a href="http://ep.espacenet.com/">European Patent Office</a>.
In the "Der neue Parawing UL" article he mentions that the concept may be used
for non-commercial purposes. Beringer's book, "Parawings Mit erfolgreicher Technik zur Faszination",
ISBN 3-88180-091-3, describes the Parawing UL along with a lot of other interesting designs
and information.
<p>
The main differences between the designs are:
<p>
</p><table class="nice">
<tbody><tr><th></th><th>Volplane</th><th>Parawing UL</th><th>Volkite</th></tr>
<tr><th>Major rib length</th><td>almost full</td><td>full</td><td>full</td></tr>
<tr><th>Sections</th><td>7 or 9</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><th>Cells per section</th><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>

<tr><th>Major rib bridle points</th><td>5 or 4</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><th>Planform</th><td>rectangular</td><td>tapered rectangle</td><td>rectangular</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
It is interesting that the major ribs in the Volplane design do not go
all the way to the TE of the canopy. Unsupported TE usually indicates flapping
unless other design steps are taken. The Volplane has a valve system incorporated
in the rear section of the lower skin allowing inflation from the rear of the cell.
<p>
<img class="box" src="eIMG_3398_bottom_front_right.jpg" width="800" height="685" alt="Volkite bottom front right view">

<h3>Design</h3>

Not having access to the complete design of either the Volplane or the Parawing UL, I decided to
create my own interpretation. Design choices are divided into profile creation, plan design, and bridling.

<h4>Profile</h4>

The profile view below shows the layout of the mini-ribs, full length
ribs, and the end pieces. Red dots and dashed lines show the control points for
the splines which define the rib curves. The yellow dots are the bridle points.
Section one is the mini-rib outline.
Section two shows where it is cut off at the end allowing air passage between adjoining cells.
<p>
<img class="box" src="volkiteProfile4.jpg" width="671" height="479" alt="Volkite Profile">
<p>
Sections 1+2+3 defines the area of the full length rib. In this prototype, there is no
hole in the full length rib to allow airflow between the chambers.
<p>
The end pieces are the defined by the outline of sections 1+2+3+4. There are
only two bridle point connections on the end pieces. Each full length rib has four bridle connections.
Each square in the profile view is scaled by 4.7 for the full sized kite.
<p>
The chamber size is 1/3 of the chord. This lies somewhere between the 1/4 seen
in the Beringer design and the 1/2 shown in the Volplane patent. The angle of the
nose opening is 45&deg; and sized to be 9% of chord length. The intention is for
the cells to inflate quickly and retain inflation over a large range of AOA's
without adding much drag.
<p>
There is no reflex in the profile. This makes the design more powerful
but carries with it a positive moment which contributes to collapse. The
profile curve is deep. This also makes the design more powerful, plus it
reduces the amount of bridles needed across the chord. The extreme of this
would be a <a href="../npwc/">NPWC</a> style canopy which can fly
without bridles directly from the lines.
<p>
In both the full length and end plate ribs, the connection to the TE
is concave. This is shown by the last Bézier control point in the upper
canopy creating an angle &gt;90&deg; to the TE of the rib fabric. I.e., the connection
between the upper canopy and ribs is concave. Any unsupported convex edges
would indicate flutter and loss of canopy inflation. The two most critical
places to retain pressure/inflation are inside the LE cells, and at the TE
of the canopy.
<p>
The following CAD code was used to generate the profile picture above:
<p>
<pre class="box">
; side view, 1/4.7 size of 1.5m^2 plan
; top skin
_Curve 0,1 0,4.5 11,6 15,0 _enter
; bottom skin
_Curve 1,0 4,0 5,4 _enter
; tips
_Polyline 0,1 2,-1 7,-1 10,-5 15,0 _enter
; ribs
_Polyline 2,-1 4.5,1.5 6,0 8.5,1.5 10,0 12.5,.5 14,-1 _enter
; min-rib cutoff
_Line 4,4 5.5,2
; bridle points
_Points 2,-1 6,0 10,0 14,-1 10,-5 _enter
</pre>
<p>
The bridle points on the full length ribs are equidistant, every 4 units.
The loading of the bridles
is greater at the LE in static flight. The full length ribs are notched and
have several small LE's just forward of each bridle point.
In general, these are designed
to be shorter that the edges just after each bridle point. The LE's of the
last three bridle points are 1.5*sqrt(2) long. Outer bridle points have
90&deg; corners, inner bridle points have blunter (&gt;90&deg;) corners.
No cross ventilation holes for the full length ribs are shown in the profile drawing.
The external parts of this rib (after the cells) are purposely solid to help
channel airflow so it remains parallel to the chord.
<p>
Section 2 in the profile picture is the cut-off section of the mini-rib.
This both simplifies the sewing of the mini-rib to top and bottom canopies and
creates an air-channel to balance the inflation of adjoined cells. The banana which
typically occurs a the narrow point where the rib joins upper and lower canopies
is avoided in this design by omitting the narrow part of the rib.
<p>
The end ribs are larger than the inner full length ribs and have fewer bridle
points. The larger size serves two purposes:
<p>
<ul><li> Helping to hold the canopy inflated. Without the end plates, air
would flow off the end of the canopy and not stay parallel to the chord.
</li><li> Increase the effective AR of the canopy. AR contributes to L/D, so
canopy material can be synergisticly applied here.
</li></ul>
The majority of the end rib plate material is toward the TE. This helps promote
stability. Each straight section of the bottom edge of the rib is 5 units long
because a 3,4,5 triangle was used in the design.
Using only two bridle points for the end ribs was influenced by previous
<a href="../npwc/">NPWC</a> work. This reduced the amount of tuning available
to the tips and is addressed further in the <a href="#tips">Tips</a> section.

<h4>Plan View</h4>

Below is the plan view. The 7 mini-ribs and the dual skin portion of the kite is
limited to the first third of the canopy. The 6 full ribs extend to the rear of the
canopy. Because the top skin wraps the curved ribs, it is actually longer than the
projected chord would indicate: 112cm, or almost 60% longer than the chord. Each
square in the below view is scaled by 23.5 for the full size kite.
<p>
<img class="box" src="volkiteTop4.jpg" width="585" height="261" alt="Volkite Plan View">
<p>
The plan view shows seven sections divided by the major ribs. This is not a magic
number, it was chosen to be similar to the Volplane design. There could just as easily
be more or less sections. More sections will give a greater AR and may generate a better
L/D.
<p>
The following is the CAD code used to generate the plan view above:
<p>
<pre class="box">
; top view, 1/23.5 size of 1.5m^2 plan
;          (1/5 size of side view above)

</pre>
<p>

The in flight canopy fabric bends in two directions. This plan shows an "unroll" flat projection
only along the span. An "unroll" in both span and chord would show a plan which was less rectangular.
<p>
This plan does not show the line where the upper skin joins the lower skin. In reality,
this line would be 1/3 the way from the nose, and the mini-ribs would be a little bit
shorter, as they do not extend to the upper/lower skin join.


<h4>Bridling</h4>

<img class="rbox" src="IMG_3371_bottom_back_s.jpg" width="400" height="496" alt="Volkite bottom back view">
<p>
A view of the bridle is shown in the picture to the right. The nose chambers are to
the left in the picture. The middle orange lines are used to adjust the profile
shape across the entire span of the canopy. The orange lines at the top and bottom
of the picture are connected to the end panel tip lines and used as a primitive way
to steer the kite.
<p>
The initial bridle plan is chosen to ease tuning and testing of this kite.
Bridles are grouped across the span of the kite, where the entire LE is in
the first group, the second bridle point on all ribs are in the second
group, and so on.
<p>
As seen
below, having each bridle line the same length results in a crown canopy. Each bridle
connected to the canopy is 211cm long. The physical construction is lengths of dyneema
twice that long with ends tied to the bridle points and a central larks head connection
to the orange bridle adjustment lines.
<p>
The image to the right is from the kite flying off a bar. The orange bridle adjustment
lines are connected to the center line. The tip lines are larks head connected to the bar
end lines for control. This is only done to test the overall design. Steering only through
the tip lines gives inadequate control.
<p>
<img class="box" src="volkiteBridle4.jpg" width="343" height="362" alt="Volkite Bridle Plan">
<p>
There are five groups of canopy lines connected to the orange bridle adjustment lines. Each
group is numbered in the picture below. The yellow ovals indicate a sinle line which runs
from the canopy to the bridle point and back up to the canopy. Group 5 is a special case
of the lines used to control the tips. Since the lines are grouped spanwise instead of
chordwise, it is very easy to adjust the overall AOA and also conduct depower experiments.
A "finished" version of this kite would probably use chord wise cascaded bridles to minimize
the amount of bridle line used.
Using the pictured test bridle plan, two depower modes are accessible:
<p>
<ul><li>Reduce camber of profile by shortening orange lines controlling groups two and three.
</li><li>Reduce AOA to (or past) the point where TE lines have no tension and canopy flutters
by progressive reduction in groups two, three, and four.
</li></ul>

<img class="box" src="volkiteBridlePlan.jpg" width="585" height="261" alt="Volkite Plan View">
<p>
As mentioned above, each white bridle line is 211cm long.
The orange lines in the pictures is the cascaded bridle harness connected to the white
lines and used to tune the kite. A cascade was used because it is straight forward
to use Prusik knots in a cascade to adjust line lengths.
The table below gives the equivalent straight line lengths, calculated from the
start of the tip lines. Group numbers are the same as in the picture above.
<p>
<ol>
<li>18 (the leading edge group)</li>
<li>24</li>
<li>26</li>
<li>29</li>
<li>0 (the tip group)</li>
</ol>
<p>
This follows the normal expectation for a parafoil parachute: the leading edge lines
are shorter than the TE lines. At first blush this looks like bridling for a
negative AOA, but since the front part of the canopy creates more lift (creating
more tension on the fronts than the rears), there
is in fact a positive overall AOA in flight.
<p>
I don't expect these are the optimum, just the lengths I ended up with after a
couple of hours testing. They are a good starting point, though.
<p>
CAD code for the bridle plan follows. This only shows the crown formed by
the lines connected to the canopy, not the orange bridle adjustment lines.

<h3><a name="tips">Tips</a></h3>

Tip lines can be adjusted independently.
Soft kites should have "wash in" incorporated into their design, i.e. the AOA at the tip
of the kite should be higher than at the center.
<p>
The Volkite tip design was influenced by earlier <a href="../npwc/">NPWC</a> work
and uses only two lines. Testing revealed a couple of problems with this approach,
the foremost being that there are not enough lines to support the shape of the
fabric while adjusting the AOA of the tip. The picture above shows the front part
of the tip bulging outward when the tip lines are pulled in to adjust the AOA.
<p>
The next two pictures shows a rear view the effects of tip lines at different lengths.
The first is when the lines are shortened to increase the tip AOA. This does
have that effect, but also "cones" the kite, bringing the sides of the canopy in
and adding drag. An improvement to this would be adjusting the bridle of the major
rib next to the tip so the AOA half way between the main canopy and the tip. However, this would
not alleviate the "bulging of the tip" problem.
<p>
The second picture shows the tip lines adjusted to give a reasonable TE shape all
the way to the tips. The AOA of the tip is likely too low, as
I noticed some tip collapses when flying in this configuration.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_3301_rear_s.jpg" width="400" height="376" alt="Volkite rear view">
&nbsp;
<img class="box" src="IMG_3409_rear_left_s.jpg" width="400" height="376" alt="Volkite rear left view">
<p>
After obsessing about this for a few days, I made some models of tip possibilities, shown below.
<p>
Models are color-coded according to part. Yellow is used for the main
canopy skin, green for the bottom skin. Major ribs are in blue, and mini-ribs
are red. The tips in their different designs are shown in purple. The white dots
represent the bridle connection points.
<p>
Below is the current Volkite tip setup and then a configuration closer to a
standard Volplane. The advantage to using more bridle lines at the tips
is better control of the tip shape at various angles of attack and less air
escaping across the tip.
<p>
<img class="box" src="VolkiteNow.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="Volkite current tip">
&nbsp;
<img class="box" src="VolkiteImprovedTips.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="Volkite improved tip">
<p>
There are two things I don't like about the above tip configurations:
<p>
<ol><li>There is a major discontinuity at the corners where the tip skin
joins the cells. The top skin stops at the top of the last cell, and effectively
starts again at the bottom of the same cell where the tip skin starts curving down.
If the top of the tip skin is thought of as a continuation of the top skin, then this
means that there is effectively a decrease in the starting AOA of the tips which
has to be compensated for to achieve a tip AOA which is greater than the center
part of the canopy.
</li><li>The span between the control lines across the canopy is suddenly larger
in the tip area. When traveling across the canopy, each section is bridled. The exception
is at the tips where there is about double the span between the tip lines and
the next bridle points at the last major rib.
</li></ol>
<p>
We can't totally trash the second configuration above, though. It was involved in the Volplane
design which tested to a maximum L/D of 4.3, which is exceptional for a canopy which uses so
little fabric.
<p>
This does not stop me from doing a mind experiment of the cross pollination possible between
the Volplane and NASA Parawing world. Shown below is a Volkite with tips inspired from a
typical NPW.
<p>
<img class="box" src="VolkiteNPWtips.jpg" width="450" height="374" alt="Volkite NASA Parawing tip">
<p>
This addresses both dissatisfactions from the list above. There is continuity from the
top skin to the tip skin. Bridling is more uniform, with the tip well supported from the final
major rib and the LE lines on the tip skin.
<p>
What if the gene splicing is done in the other direction: take a vanilla NPW and add
in some components to simplify the bridling and stiffen the LE? Something like the below
might pop out, a NASA Parawing which uses a rib shaped load curtain to reduce the number
of bridle points, and cells in the nose to allow lower AOA and resulting higher L/D.
<p>
The model imagined below also uses a canted keel, as shown in the best performing
designs originally developed by the NASA engineers and documented on the
<a href="../nasa/">NASA Parawing Research</a> page. Testing would have to be done
to see what cant angle to use as as the rib must be appropriately aligned
to the under-wing airflow.
<p>
<img class="box" src="VolNasa1.jpg" width="450" height="338" alt="NASA Parawing Volkite">
&nbsp;
<img class="box" src="VolNasa2.jpg" width="466" height="338" alt="NPW Volkite">
<p>
Suddenly, the mind explodes with possibilities for wide NPW's with multiple keels and ribs
with progressive cant angles across the span. I will limit myself here to looking at the small corner where
the top skin meets the tip skin. If additional stiffness is found to be needed in this corner,
a cell extension could be used to create an additional chamber in the tip, pictured below.
<p>
<img class="box" src="VolCorner.jpg" width="450" height="226" alt="Volkite NASA Parawing LE corner treatment">
<p>
This cell extension is shown as open in the front, but could just as well be closed. Cross ventilation
holes are assumed to be used as necessary in the designs above, and would serve to inflate any cell which
is closed in the front.
<p>
There appear to be many fruitful avenues of exploration when considering the cross breeding
between NASA Parawings and Volkites. This is not surprising as the Volplane patent
itself was a "continuation in part" of the "<a href="../../patent/3428277/">Everett Parawing</a>" patent,
which describes performance improvements of NASA Parawings.

<h3>Future</h3>

From the past: Volkite robots are found in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undersea_Kingdom">Undersea Kingdom</a> (1936),
to the future.
<p>
Plan of action ordered by time:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Flight on longer lines with brake line steering. A test harness was used
to test the kite and make basic bridle tuning. Tip lines were used as a primitive
method to steer the kite. Flight under real conditions will help to determine
further bridle tuning and effects of tip line length adjustment.</li>
<li>Simplified design for construction. The current design is pretty simple, except for joining
the cell sections to major ribs. This requires a sew join where the outer layers
are straight lines and the inner layer is quite curved. It can be done, but requires
skill and a lot of patience to get accurate and repeatable results.
There is all the necessary information in this article for an experienced kite
maker to recreate the current version this kite. The long term plan is a design for easier construction
and a more detailed step by step plan which is more generally accessible.</li>
<li>Major rib vent holes in the cells. There are currently no vent holes in order
to highlight any cells which are not correctly oriented to the flow. There would
be vent holes in a finished design.</li>
<li>Various tip experiments outlined in the section above. If only I had
lots of free time! :-)</li>
<li>Volplane style valves on the bottom skin experiments. I am not sure if these
would have any advantage in a kite design, but then again, there are lots of
things I don't know.</li>
<li>Volplane style major ribs which do not reach the TE. This will also simplify
one aspect of the construction, as the TE hem fold is currently not created until
sewing the major ribs is almost finished. I currently wait until this point to do
the TE hem because it is impossible to accurately measure the amount of slip
inherent in sewing a curved edge (the major rib) to the flat upper skin. If the
Major rib does not go all the way to the TE, then the small difference in sewing
slip can be absorbed by the non rib connected TE section.</li>
</ul>
