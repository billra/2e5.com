<p>
Maeko a sparless single skin SLE sled using tailored bumps on the leading edge
to maintain canopy shape. It is lighter, uses less material, and is easier to
make than a standard parafoil.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Flat aspect ratio: 5.1</li>
<li>Area: 1 m<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Tip to Tip: 225 cm</li>
<li>Center chord: 57.4 cm</li>
</ul>
<p>
Maeko is a minimalistic soft kite with nice flying characteristics. It is a
result of the experiments done with
<a href="../npwc/foilnose3/">Foil Nose 3</a>.

<h3>Design Highlights</h3>

The combination of four key features come together in the Maeko design:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Tailored leading edge bumps.</li>
<li>All flat sewing.</li>
<li>SLE bridle.</li>
<li>Load and sheet tension lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In detail:

<h4>Tailored LE Bumps</h4>
Both <a href="../yagu/">Yagu</a> and <a href="../npwc/foilnose3/">Foil Nose 3</a>
use LE cell openings which are perpendicular to the font of the kite. This is
done for construction simplification, but is aerodynamically suboptimal. A
judder, reminiscent of a flat sheet being held facing the wind, can be felt as
the air alternates between being spilled above and below the canopy when flying these
models close to the edge of the window.
<p>
Maeko uses a tailored cone "bump" to create an aerodynamic shape which
is more pleasing to the wind.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_6496s.JPG" width="592" height="700" alt="Maeko top view">
<p>
The top of the picture shows the opening of the bumps is 45&deg; to the front of
the kite, more like a normal airfoil. The bumps are roughly conical in shape.
They are sewn to the canopy in a straight line.
<p>
The shaping of the bumps is done with curved notches in the leading edge. A long
and short bump is shown below before sewing creates the three dimensional shape.
<p>
<img class="box" src="MaekoBumps.png" width="270" height="346" alt="Maeko Bumps">
<p>
The curved edges 'c' are sewn together to form a straight leading edge made from
'b' and 'd'. The small end of the cone is treated similarly and sewn to the canopy.
Line 'a' is the main sew line to the canopy. This produces the bump shape shown
in the flying Maeko above.
<p>
Two sizes of bumps are used to prevent the chamber termination "spanwise wrinkle"
problem described in <a href="../npwc/foilnose3/">Foil Nose 3</a>. They also
fit well with the narrowing span at the tips.

<h4>All Flat Sewing</h4>
In a typical foil kite, sew lines having differing curvature must be joined.
For example, sewing the top part of a rib (curved line) to a canopy (straight line).
For me, this often results in discouragement at the end of a sew line when
the ends of the sewn parts do not match. I have not mastered the skill of preventing
parts from creeping when sewing non-matching curves.
<p>
The Maeko design only sews curves to matching curves. This allows parts to lie flat
against each other during sewing. Part creep is entirely eliminated by temporary
tape applied before sewing. For example, when sewing the bumps in the picture above:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fold notch 'c' in half so both the corners and bottom of notch match. Looking
through the fabric, see that the curve matches exactly.</li>
<li>Tape the edges 'b' and 'd' together to hold the fold in place.</li>
<li>Sew along the curve line 'c'. Flip the part over and see that the back of the sew
line is also on the curve line.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is also true for the panel sew line joining the three sections of the canopy.

<h4>SLE Bridle</h4>
The Maeko bridle is SLE style for light weight and low windage. There are three
bumps between each bridle point. The bridle is created
using a double cascade with <a href="../npwc/twolinebridle/">Prusik Knots</a>
for easy adjustment.
<p>
<img class="box" src="MaekoBridle.png" width="569" height="491" alt="Maeko Bridle">
<p>
Segments 'a' and 'b' are part of a single line. The line is tied through the canopy
in between two bumps on the leading edge. The LE load line (see next section) is
also captured inside this tie for strength. A Prusik knot is used at 'A' for
adjusting the length of 'a' versus 'b'.
<p>
In the same way, segments 'c' and 'd' are part of a single line. Loops are at each end of this
line. One loop Prusiks to the top line at 'A' and the other loop larks
heads to the load and sheet tension lines at 'L'.
<p>
At point 'B' is a short loop of line with a knot. The loop creates a Prusik knot
for adjusting the length of 'c' versus 'd'. The knot is the front control line
attachment point.

<h4>Load and Sheet Tension Lines</h4>
There are separate load (orange) and sheet tension (white) lines for both
the LE and TE. The orange load line is a thick dyneema line designed to take
the main load of the control lines. The white sheet tension line is used
for tensioning the canopy fabric.
<p>
In the picture below, the rear load line is in the tunnel formed from the
hem fold in the TE. It is free to move inside this fold. The rear tensioning
line is sewn along the line of the hem fold sew line.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_6572s.JPG" width="728" height="400" alt="Rear Load and Sheet Tension Lines">
<p>
Below is the same configuration for the LE. The front load line is also free to move.
It is inserted between the bump LE and main canopy LE after they are sewn together. The
front tensioning line is sewn onto the canopy LE hem before the bumps are sewn on.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_6573s.JPG" width="848" height="400" alt="Front Load and Sheet Tension Lines">
<p>
I considered using a thicker dacron fabric to carry the loads along the LE and TE instead of these
dyneema lines. However, with mixed fabric there is a risk of non-uniform stretching/contraction
causing unwanted bunching/warping as the kite ages. Also, having lines gives more
adjustment opportunities. These waters are untested &ndash; the current setup is
to tension each edge with light (1-2 kg?), wrinkle free force and tie matching load
and sheet tension lines together.

<h3>Construction Plans</h3>

<img class="rbox" src="MaekoColorsTall.png" width="390" height="1328" alt="Maeko plan view">
<p>
Anyone interested can build and improve this kite. The plans are free for download and personal use.
The primary source is the <a href="Maeko15a3.3dm">Rhino drawing</a> of Maeko. The plans
are generated by a parametric design program like the one described in the
<a href="http://2e5.com/kite/parametric/">Parametric Kite Design</a> article.
<p>
<a href="http://www.rhino3d.com/">Rhino</a>
is my favorite 3D CAD program. An evaluation version can be downloaded
and used to print these plans. Perfect if you know your way around CAD and want
to print templates to a specific paper size or have the luxury of plotting directly on ripstop.
<p>
A3 size templates were generated from the Rhino file above and saved in
the <a href="Maeko15a3.pdf">Maeko A3 pdf</a> design file. Great if you have
an A3 size laser printer.
The <a href="Maeko15a3.dxf">dxf file</a> was created by exporting the Rhino 3dm
file. Handy if you speak CAD, but not Rhino.
<p>
The lines shown in the plan are the sew lines and the outer edges of the fold lines.
I use a 1 cm width between a sew and cut line. For a double fold hem, I use
1.8 cm width with a 0.8 cm fold in the inside and 1 cm fold on the outside.
I use the longest possible stitch length when straight stitching, and the appropriate
step length so that triple zig-zag ends up with 90&deg; corners.
<p>
Below is an outline of construction.
<a href="mailto:billra@gmail.com?Subject=Maeko%20Construction">Ask away</a>
if you see ambiguities. If this design
becomes popular, I will write a detailed construction article incorporating
answers your questions to deflect email load.
<p>
<ol class="A">

<li>Before sewing:<ol>
<li>Create templates for canopy tip section, (half of the) canopy center, canopy bump sew lines,
and both bumps.
I create a second set of templates for the bumps so I can quickly draw both the sew
and cut/fold lines instead of manually measuring from a single template.</li>
<li>Double check that the templates are not "out of kilter", see tips below.</li>
<li>Mark the fabric using the templates.</li>
<li>Cut parts out of fabric. Wait to cut fabric from between the notches until
after the notch is sewn.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Main panel:<ol>
<li>Sew together the main panels. Use a window (or light table) to align the
sew lines. Use tape around the hem to stabilize the material for sewing.</li>
<li>Sew panel join hem flat to the top side of the panel. Ensure that "pulling apart"
tension is applied to the panels while sewing so that the second sew line only flattens
the hem instead of creating a new canopy shape.</li>
<li>Double fold and sew the canopy tips with a triple zig-zag.</li>
<li>Double fold and sew the leading edge with a triple zig-zag.</li>
<li>Sew a tensioning pigtail line to each end of the LE.</li>
<li>Straight stitch the double fold on the canopy TE to create a channel for the TE load line.
You will be threading a line in this channel, so prepare the fabric join sections of the
channel before sewing so that a line will not be snagged here when threading.</li>
<li>Sew a tensioning pigtail line to each end of the TE.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Bumps:<ol>
<li>Sew all bump LE notches. Sew line should go
all the way to the edge of the fabric to make handling easier.
Remember to align notch lines and use tape to stabilize
as was done when joining canopy sections.</li>
<li>Sew all bump TE notches. Same procedure as bump LE notch sewing.
Notch fold should be on same side of
fabric for both LE and TE of bump.</li>
<li>Cut excess fabric out of notches. I leave about 1 cm to the notch sew line.</li>
<li>Double fold and triple stitch LE of all bumps.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Bumps to main panel:<ol>
<li>Mark the front of the LE every 15 cm.</li>
<li>Use bump sew line templates and these marks to mark sew lines on top of canopy.</li>
<li>Attach the TE of the bump to the canopy. Tape to hold position, then sew.</li>
<li>Test by hand that the LE of the bump can reach the LE of the canopy following the sew path on both sides.</li>
<li>Align the bump so the front of the sew line exactly intersects the mark at the LE of the canopy.
Tape as necessary to hold exact position until sewn.</li>
<li>Sew bump down starting at LE moving toward TE.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Load line:<ol>
<li>Thread a load line through the TE tube. I use a line taped to a stiff long thin wire.</li>
<li>Thread a load line centered above the LE hem but below the bump LE hems. I use a dull needle
to make a space between the sewn layers and a strong thread to pull the load line through.</li>
<li>Adjust the length of the load line by tensioning opposite tensioning pigtail lines and trimming
load line to same length.</li>
<li>Overhand knot end of load line and canopy tension line together.</li>
</ol></li>

<li>Bridle:<ol>
<li>Cut lengths of dyneema to satisfy measurements in bridle length table in
the Flight section below.</li>
<li>Cut short lengths of thicker dyeema for lower Prusik knot.</li>
<li>Knot ends togeter of thicker dyneema section to create loop.</li>
<li>Prusik knot this loop to line of lower leg.</li>
<li>Create loops in ends of lower leg line.</li>
<li>Prusik knot one end of lower leg line to upper leg line.</li>
<li>Larks head the other end of the lower leg line to the LE tension/load pigtail.</li>
<li>Sew both ends of the upper leg through the LE of the canopy and bumps, capturing the LE load line.</li>
</ol></li>

</ol>
<p>
Construction tips:
<p>
<ul>
<li>This should not be your first kite build. This is not a challenging design,
but many details are glossed over. Sort out kite building principles by first
building the very nice
<a href="http://members.shaw.ca/kiteman/">NPW9b</a>.</li>
<li>Important tip for template printing: the grid size is 1cm. If your device output
does not reflect this then the templates will be, to use technical jargon,
"out of kilter". Device output inaccuracies can be compensated for by pre-processing,
but this is the subject of a future article.</li>
<li>Build the 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> shown here first. Building small before building
large will magically be faster than building large alone. Mistakes made and improvements
discovered during model size construction will pay time dividends. It's also nice to know a
kite works in more than just the designer's back yard before committing
expensive square meters of ripstop.</li>
<li>Rule of thumb: All folds are toward the top of the canopy. For the canopy this means that the bottom is flat.
For the bumps this means the curved joins and the LE hem end up on the inside of the chamber.</li>
<li>Use light fabric colors for first builds. If using a dark color you need to plan on which
side of the fabric to mark based on when it needs to be seen.</li>
<li>Remove tape after sewing.</li>
<li>Sew short bumps to the panel first, then go back and attach the long bumps.</li>
<li>I attach the TE of the bumps to the canopy "back to back" so the TE flap of the bump ends up inside the bump.</li>
<li>Because three panels are joined to create the canopy, the LE length may not end up being
exactly 225 cm. As long as the length is not off by more than a few mm, the difference
can be distributed equally between each cell when marking the LE for the bump sew lines.</li>
<li>Sewing down the bump must keep the canopy material flat and not tension or wrinkle it. It is ok
to have a little extra bump material when sewing arrives at the rear corner of the bump,
but it is <em>not</em> ok to have extra canopy material.</li>
<li>Tape is great for holding flat sewing pieces in position. However, avoid taping over
sew lines and never sew through tape.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last step is bridle adjustment and tuning, covered in the next section.

<h3>Flight</h3>
Here we setup the bridle and take Maeko for a spin.
<p>
Some kite design programs produce measurements for SLE bridles. I have never
tried these &ndash; do they work out of the box? If so, I am seriously impressed.
The only way I could see this calculation being correct is for the design program
to know how much lift is being generated on the canopy at every bridle
connection point.
<p>
I do SLE bridle adjustment by making a drawing of the desired bridle shape,
then fine-tuning based on how (the leading edge of) the kite behaves. Here
are some bridle measurements taken from my current setup. Letter labels
are from the diagram in the SLE bridle section.
<p>
<table class="nice"><tbody>
<tr><th></th><th>Length</th></tr>
<tr><th>Line 1, section a</th><td>78.5</td></tr>
<tr><th>Line 1, section b</th><td>49.5</td></tr>
<tr><th>Line 2, section c</th><td>48.0</td></tr>
<tr><th>Line 2, section d</th><td>58.2</td></tr>
<tr><th>Prusik Pigtail B</th><td>7.1</td></tr>
<tr><th>Rear Extension</th><td>66.5</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
These values are all 'ideal bridle' 'canopy to knot' or 'knot to knot' measurements. They include
the canopy load/tension pigtail. Lines will need to be made longer than this to
facilitate implementation, e.g., Prusik loops and slipknot connection to canopy.
<p>
There is an interplay between the length/tension on the rear lines and the SLE bridle settings
on the front lines. Different lengths/tensions on the rear lines match different ideal front
line bridle settings. Because of this, a bar (with the ability to lock the front line
connection pigtail) is the preferred input method so relative lengths between the front
and rear lines can be strictly controlled.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_6579_bar.JPG" width="680" height="300" alt="Simple kite bar">
<p>
In the bar above, the front lines are connected to the central bar adjustable line and the
rear lines are connected bar end lines. There are a couple of advantages with this
setup:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The kite can be landed (backed down) by removing the central line from the clamcleat and
slowly letting it out.</li>
<li>A similar maneuver can be done to reverse launch from a nose down crash.</li>
<li>In an emergency, removing the line from the clamcleat will drop the kite from the sky.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ok, with the preliminaries out of the way it is time for the bridle tuning procedure.
Start with the bridle length setup shown in the table above, and the central bar line let out.
Perform bridle adjustments to both sides of the kite equally.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Start pulling in the central line until the kite launches.</li>
<li>Near apogee, keep pulling in until part of the canopy collapses, then back off.</li>
<li>Land the kite. Depending on which part of the canopy collapsed, a different adjustment is needed:<ol class="a">
<li>If the top of the canopy collapses first, use the Prusik knot at 'A' to lengthen 'a' (shortening 'b').</li>
<li>If the shoulder of the canopy collapses first, use the Prusik knot at 'A' to lengthen 'b' (shortening 'a').</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Repeat until canopy collapses evenly under a shortened central bar line.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Read the "AOA indicators" section of the <a href="../yagu/">Yagu</a> article for more
information about attack angles of individual canopy sections.
<p>
What about the lower Prusik knot adjustment?
It controls two things:
<p>
<ul>
<li>How 'open' the SLE kite is.</li>
<li>The twist angle of the canopy tip.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Use Prusik 'B' to shorten 'c' (lengthening 'd') to make the kite  more 'open'
or 'flatter'. This will cause the tip to be more twisted (have a higher angle of attack)
when the TE line is tensioned. The converse adjustment will make the kite more "C" shaped.
<p>
Each lower Prusik knot setting will have a different matching upper Prusik knot setting and
rear line length/tension setting. Thus, the upper Prusik knot setting procedure will
have to be carried out whenever the lower Prusik knot position is changed.
<p>
See flying angle picture below. The game is to make bridle adjustments giving the
highest possible flying angle without canopy collapse or other bad behavior under
normal flying conditions.
I got Maeko to go this high in about 10 minutes of fiddling with the bridle
and rear line tension.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_6469rs.JPG" width="400" height="888" alt="Maeko flying angle">
<p>
You can probably do better! Gain world fame: send me a nice picture and I will place it here for
others to admire.
<p>
Maeko pulls harder than its size would indicate. Single skin nature:
all of the canopy is being used. There is no trailing edge section "just along for
the ride" like some dual skin foils.

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

After a crash, the central canopy TE may fold behind itself. A couple of sharp pulls on the
TE lines will clear this.
<p>
Before the first test flight, I was concerned that cell openings may fold inward.
This is never a problem in practice. I saw this one time when a bridling problem (see next
item) caused a part of the canopy to fly at the wrong angle. But otherwise, this aspect
exceeded expectations.
<p>
The below picture shows a bridling problem that appeared out of nowhere during the
second day of flight. Look closely at the right hand side bridle.
There is a straight line from the central canopy bridle connection point and the 'B' Prusik
pigtail. The 'b' portion of the upper line is slack!
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_6549s.JPG" width="616" height="600" alt="Maeko bottom view">
<p>
The root cause is the front line twisting the 'B' Prusik point so badly that the
lower cascade is twisted and shortened. This causes the right half of the kite to
collapse. I am a little bit puzzled at this behavior as I have never seen a kite line
twist a bridle like this before. For now I will put bearing swivels at each bar line
connection point.
<p>
Flying on handles will prove quite challenging because of the relationship between
SLE bridling and rear line tension/length described in the Flight section. Best to
stick to a bar.

<h3>Future</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bigger. I was positively surprised how well this flew right out of the box. I will be
making a larger version (with tweaks below) to power some of my wind driven activities.</li>
<li>Bump TE corners. Having the notches in the middle of the TE of the bump
made sew alignment harder than it necessary. Next design will have the curved notches
in the corners.</li>
<li>Shorter center SLE line. The 'v' bottom of the upper SLE descends lower than necessary.
This line can be made shorter.</li>
<li>Different bar setup. Experiment to see if routing both LE and TE lines to a central bar
point would increase stability. Tip lines on the control bar can be routed to pull on
the TE lines routed to the center of the bar.</li>
<li>The above is a first step to an autozenith experiment. See if the above and TE tip point
weighting or spar will induce autozenith behavior.</li>
</ul>
All in all, this is the most successful kite experiment so far: there are no critical
elements in the list above.
