<p>
Because of the long summer days (sunrise 3:30 am, sunset 10:00 pm during midsummer)
Denmark is an ideal place to have summer vacation. In our trip we explored parts of Fyn
and Jutland.
<h3>H.C. Andersen's House</h3>
Our stop in Odense was the birthplace of H.C. Andersen.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4338a.JPG" alt="H.C. Andersen's house" width="568" height="426">
<p>
This is the house where H.C. Andersen was born. It has been turned into a museum where H.C. Andersen
artifacts are on display. The museum entrance is on the other side of the building.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4339a.JPG" alt="road beside H.C. Andersen's house" width="426" height="568">
<p>
This is the road on the left side of the H.C. Andersen house. Follow this all the way
around, keeping to the right to arrive at the entrance of the museum.
The street has been restored to reflect the original architecture.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4342a.JPG" alt="H.C. Andersen museum" width="560" height="385">
<p>
The entrance to the H.C. Andersen museum. A modern look surrounded by water. During the outdoor
play, the little mermaid swims here.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4347a.JPG" alt="H.C. Andersen outdoor play" width="568" height="426">
<p>
An open air stage is located next to the entrance to the H.C. Andersen museum. Plays are shown
several times a day which feature stories from his works. Can you guess which story is
being shown in this picture? Hint: the main actor is actually not correctly dressed for the part.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4352a.JPG" alt="H.C. Andersen mural" width="568" height="426">
<p>
The H.C. Andersen museum is a collection of several connected buildings, including the
building where H.C. Andersen was born. The picture above shows a mural on display in the
central round room.

<h3>Egeskov</h3>
Egeskov is located on Fyn, south of Odense. Egeskov contains a 40 acre park, many museums,
an outdoor maze, and a castle.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4379a.JPG" alt="Egeskov castle" width="568" height="283">
<p>
To get to Egeskov castle, you of course must cross a large moat. Inside you can tour many of the rooms.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4389a.JPG" alt="Suit of Armor" width="365" height="560">
<p>
The Duke of Egeskov commissioned a copy of the suit of armor worn by his ancestor
450 years ago.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4390a.JPG" alt="Superman cape" width="252" height="560">
<p>
The Duke of Egeskov is a collector of movie memorabilia. Shown here is the Superman
outfit used by Christopher Reeve during the filming of the flying scenes in
the first Superman movie. It is teal colored to for use in blue-screen filming, with
the proper color added in during post-processing. The cape is not padded like the
non-flying outfits allowing it to "flap" properly.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4400a.JPG" alt="Wooden doll" width="568" height="426">
<p>
In the attic of the castle is a wooden doll lying on a pillow. Legend has it that
if this is ever moved, the castle will collapse into the moat on Christmas eve.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4405a.JPG" alt="Treetop walking" width="568" height="426">
<p>
I'm not fond of heights, so my wife and kids had a treetop walking tour while I stayed
on the ground and took pictures.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4406a.JPG" alt="Lotus in car barn" width="426" height="568">
<p>
This lotus is on display in the car and aircraft museum. The museum itself was once
a large barn.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4413a.JPG" alt="Unique airplane" width="568" height="426">
<p>
This is an interesting airplane. The elevator has fixed pitch. Instead the main wings act as a Canard,
taking over the function of the elevator.

<h3>Somewhere</h3>
On the way to Hegedal Strand, we stopped somewhere to eat.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4428a.JPG" alt="Railroad track bicycle" width="568" height="426">
<p>
The main attraction here was railway bicycles. Hundreds of railway bicycles setup
for tourist use, but nobody riding them. In a few years, this place will be known as
the railway bicycle ghost town.
<h3>Hegedal Strand</h3>
Hegedal strand is located on the west coast of Jylland, a little south of Aalborg.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4432a.JPG" alt="Hegedal Strand camping" width="560" height="279">
<p>
These were our accommodations for most of the trip. This is a six man tent,
with two separate sleeping areas and a "living room" where we set up our camping
furniture. The camping trips when I was growing up involved packing our horse with equipment
and supplies and two weeks of hiking somewhere far in the Cascade range. In comparison, a trip with a
car and huge tent is decadent.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4442a.JPG" alt="Flying the HQ NPW5 LK88" width="413" height="550">
<p>
My oldest daughter is flying a HQ NPW5 LK88 on the beach beside the campsite. It's only half a square
meter, but the wind was strong enough to drag her down the beach. This kite has some sentimental
value, as it is the first NPW I ever flew. The kite store
<a href="http://www.dragestedet.dk">dragestedet.dk</a> has good
customer service. After complaining about getting the LK88 (I had ordered a larger model),
I was asked to keep the LK88 in way of apology for the mis-filled order.
<h3>Frederikshavn</h3>
We lived in Frederikshavn when we first came to Denmark. Back then we stayed with my grandmother
in my father's childhood home. Seeing Frederikshavn again brought back a lot of memories.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4452a.JPG" alt="Frederikshavn Tower" width="560" height="501">
<p>
The Gunpowder Tower (Krudtt√•rnet) was constructed in 1688 to guard the harbor. The naval mine
came much later, this one was discovered sometime after WW2.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4499a.JPG" alt="Palm beach" width="560" height="231">
<p>
A new attraction to the Frederikshavn area is "palm beach" complete with palm trees,
volleyball nets and an icecream stand. It was a little cold on the day we visited.
(I think it is a little cold on most days. :-)
<h3>Skagen</h3>
Skagen is the northern most city in Denmark.
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4458a.JPG" alt="Grenen Skagen" width="568" height="426">
<p>
The northern tip of Denmark is located at Skagens Gren. In the picture you see
the tip where Kattegat and the Skagerrak (straights connected to the North sea) meet.
The Kattegat waves are travelling towards Skagerrak, and the Skagerrak waves
are heading towards Kattegat. At the tip, where the waves meet, the seas are confused.

<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4487a.JPG" alt="German Bunker" width="568" height="426">
<p>
A bunker constructed during the German occupation of Denmark during WW2.
More information about these bunkers can be found at
<a href="http://www.atlanticwall.polimi.it/museum/bunker/bunker_danemark.php?inventory_ID=156#">
The Atlantic Wall.</a>
<p>
<img class="box" src="IMG_4495a.JPG" alt="Sand Church" width="402" height="560">
<p>
The Sand Church ("Den Tilsandede Kirke") located just outside of Skagen.
It started life as a large church with a tall bell tower. Over time, the moving sands
covered the church, and now only the bell tower can be seen.
<p>
Personally, I'm suspicious of this story. It seems much more likely that someone ran
out of money after building a short tower and made up a story to attract gullible tourists.
However, the sand dunes surrounding the church are quite large, so I'm undecided on what the truth
actually is.
<p>
In exchange for money, you are allowed to climb a small unlighted
stone stairway to see what the "back side" of the brick
dome construction looks like. From there, climb wooden scaffolding to look out
the upper windows.
<p>
Thanks for dropping by!
