<h1>Katrinedalsvej 7</h1>
<h2>Rasmussen family Stairway Project</h2>

Katrinedalsvej 7 was previously a single family residence on the main floor, with a prepress business in the cellar.
Currently the house has external access to both the cellar and main floor, with no connecting stairs internal to the structure.
This project will create a stairway between the main floor and the cellar so that the entire structure can be better utilized as a residence.

<li>starway - light wood and metal
<li>railing - light wood and metal
<li>solid construction: err on the side of "too strong"

Work items:
<ul>
<li>Remove cabinet from basement
<li>Remove closet from upstairs wall
<li>Remove door from upstairs wall
<li>Patch floor by entry

Questions
<p>
<ul>
<li>Will a 2m x 1m hole allow a reasonable spiral staircase?
<li>Stair can spiral more or less (tighter or looser) depending on head clearance and desired exit positon. How will this be calculated?
<li>Can a diamond saw cut a hole right up to the edge of a wall?
<li>How much additional support is requred for floor after cutting hole
<li>How can project be coordinated so that stairway construction starts immediately after hole is done?
</ul>

Update:

<p>
We would like to re-orient the hole and make a semi-spiral staircase.
From my measurements, the hole can be up to 106cm wide before running into the closet wall (to the right of the front door).
When it is turned this way, the hole can be up to 150 cm long. In this way, we will have steps going straight down for a
few steps, then spiral 180 degrees, then a couple of more steps and end up in the basement. I think that this will give more head clearance when going
around the spiral than the old plan.<p>
I don't think there is enough vertical clearance to have a platform instead of a spiral in the middle/bottom of the stair.
But I don't quite know how to calculate this.<p>
Also, (not shown in the drawing) I think there might be enough room to spiral in the opposite direction. In that way, the stairs will
end parallel to the section of the wall at the corner of the basement hallway. That would be nicer, plus, we could then use the pole
around the center of the spiral as part of the basement ceiling support on the side where it is needed most.
