William J. Everett Jr. filed for patent the "Gliding Parachute" 
on February 13th, 1967. Patent 3428277 was granted
on February 18th, 1969. Everett was associated with the Pioneer Parachute Company of
Manchester, Connecticut. Pioneer Aerospace obtained a license to manufacture 
parawings from NASA.
<p>
The below drawing is figure 3 from the patent. It shows a wing similar to a NASA parawing
model 5. The rounded nose of the model 5 is replaced by ram air inflated pockets on
the nose, and control lines are added to control the nose section.

<p>
Angle of attack is one of the most
critical factors in achieving a high lift to drag ratio.
However, simply reducing the angle of attack in a standard parawing causes the nose
to collapse.
The idea behind this alteration is to utilize a small ram air inflated section which
would prevent nose collapse at low angles of attack.
<p>
The patent text claims an attack angle of 15&deg; for the above model, with a resulting
lift to drag ratio of "approximately 3.7 or more."
<p>
The patent describes variations to parawing planform. Below, figure 10 shows a parawing
with multiple center panels. The patent intends to cover all variations of parawings,
the key design element being the addition of ram air chambers in the nose.

<p>
Several enhancements to the basic nose air chambers are also described. Figure 14 below
shows 3 of them on a single keel parawing variation:
<ul>
<li> Profiles added between the air chambers to better control the airfoil shape and allow
for ventelation between the chambers.
<li> A keel is used to spread line loads to the canopy, create a smooth shape, and to help
with directional stability.
<li> "Vertically extending vanes" are added to the nose to "aid in directing air inwardly
beneath the canopy to increase the lift" and "keep the leading edge of the parachute
facing in the direction of intended flight".
</ul>

<p>
This patent has many enigmatic aspects, among them:
<ul>
<li>This patent was filed in February, 1967 and granted in February, 1969. The first NASA
publication of a two keel design was in May of 1969. Since the claims in the patent do not
include the dual keel aspect, it must be that the dual keel variation was "common 
knowlege" in certian circles as early as 1967.
<li>This patent shows a design quite similar in complexity to a "standard" NASA parawing
model 5, but with an achievable lift to drag ratio considerably higher. One would expect
that this model would have been the basis for kite designs, but none have been seen so
far.
<li>There appear to be no internet references to this design either as a parachute
or a kite. This design does not seem to have been put into production by Pioneer Parachute.
</ul>
<p>
The idea to use ram air to prevent nose collapse has been re-invented more than once.
For example patent 4243191 "Hooded Kite", granted January 6th, 1981, appears to use exactly
this idea to prevent a sled kite's nose collapse at low angles of attack.
The "Hooded Kite" patent does not reference the Everett patent.
